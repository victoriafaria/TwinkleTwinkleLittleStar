# TwinkleTwinkleLittleStar

My playground called Twinkle Twinkle Little Star is a game which possess three fun activities where children will exercise different gestures types. Those gesture types are: Draw, Tap and Pinch. They are important exercises which are going to help on the child’s motor abilities, as well as developing manual strength, control and dexterity. The purpose of this virtual playground is to have a context where the child is able to perform these activities, as well as interact with the main character “Íris - the star”.
